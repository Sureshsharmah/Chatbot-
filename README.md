This project implements an end-to-end Q&A chatbot using OpenAI and open-source Ollama LLMs with the Langchain framework. It integrates multiple language models for flexible and accurate query handling. The chatbot's user interface is built using Streamlit for easy interaction. Dotenv is used for secure management of API keys. The system demonstrates how to create an intelligent, scalable, and interactive chatbot using cutting-edge AI technologies.
